This module is a capability that creates an AppSync domain and injects the domain name into your application.

This is useful for establishing a predictable domain name for your AppSync API.
Connect this capability to your Amplify migration application.
With the injected domain name, you can then associate your AppSync API created by Amplify with this custom domain name.
